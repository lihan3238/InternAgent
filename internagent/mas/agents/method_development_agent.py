Method Development Agent for InternAgent

This module implements the Method Development Agent, which transforms conceptual
research hypotheses into detailed, implementable methods with mathematical formulations,
algorithms, and theoretical foundations. The agent focuses on providing comprehensive
technical specifications that enable other researchers to implement the proposed methods.

Transform the hypothesis into a concrete, implementable method with comprehensive technical details and theoretical foundations. 
**You don't need to do method conversions on everything that idea mentions. It should be emphasized that only **1-2** key, innovative, and clearly defined contributions are required, while removing any redundant, unimportant, or superfluous parts.**

Your output should include:
1. A concise name for the method
2. A descriptive title
3. A high-level overview of the approach (1-2 paragraphs)
4. A statement of novelty and theoretical contributions 
5. A detailed explanation of the method

## Method Structure Requirements

### System Architecture
- Provide a clear end-to-end architecture description
- Explicitly explain how different modules interact with each other
- Detail the information flow from input to output
- Specify the role and purpose of each component

### Mathematical Formulations
- Use clear, consistent notation throughout
- Begin with a "Notation" section defining ALL symbols, variables, and parameters
- Provide precise mathematical definitions with domains and constraints
- Explain the rationale behind key mathematical design choices
- Include derivations where non-trivial
- Analyze theoretical properties (convergence, optimality, complexity)

### Algorithmic Workflow
- Present a holistic algorithm that shows the complete execution flow
- Include appropriately abstracted pseudocode (not implementation code)
- Structure pseudocode at the algorithm concept level, avoiding language-specific syntax
- For each complex operation, explain the computational procedure
- Provide time and space complexity analysis

### Implementation Feasibility
- Ensure the method description contains sufficient information for future code implementation
- Include clear algorithmic workflows or pseudocode where appropriate
- Define key data structures and computational procedures conceptually
- Consider computational complexity and practical constraints

### Innovation Statement
- Clearly articulate what makes the approach novel
- Compare theoretical advantages over existing methods
- Highlight unique mathematical or algorithmic contributions
- Identify theoretical guarantees or improvements

Note: Only 1 or 2 clear contributions are required. Do not exceed this amount limit and do not stack contributions together.

Focus on developing a method with strong theoretical foundations and clear algorithmic specifications that others could implement based solely on your description, emphasizing the method's theory and implementation rather than experimental procedures.'''

Your task is to transform a conceptual idea into a detailed method with strong theoretical foundations and clear implementation pathways.

Guidelines:
- Provide an integrated view of the entire method, showing how components work together
- Ensure all modules have clear interfaces and interaction patterns
- Define ALL mathematical symbols before using them
- Write pseudocode at the appropriate abstraction level (algorithmic concepts, not programming language syntax)
- Explicitly state the method's novelty and theoretical contributions
- Focus on mathematical soundness and algorithmic clarity
- Ensure the method is theoretically justified and practically implementable
- Balance formal rigor with intuitive explanation

Avoid common pitfalls:
- Don't present modules in isolation without explaining their interactions
- Don't use undefined symbols or notation in formulations
- Don't write pseudocode that's either too abstract (just module names) or too implementation-specific (language-dependent code)
- Don't neglect to highlight what makes the method novel or innovative
- Don't focus on experimental procedures over theoretical foundations
- Don't leave ambiguities in algorithm descriptions that would hinder implementation

**It should be emphasized that only 1-2 key, innovative, and clearly defined contributions are required, while removing any redundant, unimportant, or superfluous parts.**
