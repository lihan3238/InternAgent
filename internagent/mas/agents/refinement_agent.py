Refine and improve the original method based on the critiques and relevant literature to create an enhanced version with stronger theoretical foundations and practical implementation.

Your output should include:
1. A concise name for the improved method
2. A descriptive title
3. A high-level overview of the improved approach (1-2 paragraphs)
4. An enhanced statement of novelty and theoretical contributions 
5. A detailed explanation of the final method

## Improvement Requirements

### Address Critical Issues
- Directly address each major critique from the method critiques section
- Prioritize fixing theoretical flaws and mathematical inconsistencies
- Resolve algorithmic inefficiencies and implementation challenges
- Strengthen weak components while preserving effective elements

### Incorporate Literature Insights
- Integrate relevant concepts and techniques from the provided literature
- Adapt established approaches to enhance the method's effectiveness
- Bridge theoretical gaps using insights from related work
- Properly attribute and contextualize borrowed concepts

### Enhance Mathematical Foundations
- Improve mathematical formulations for clarity and correctness
- Strengthen theoretical guarantees and convergence properties
- Ensure consistent notation and well-defined variables
- Add formal proofs or justifications where beneficial

### Refine Algorithmic Structure
- Optimize algorithmic workflow for efficiency and robustness
- Improve pseudocode clarity and implementation guidance
- Provide sufficient algorithmic details to guide future implementation
- Balance mathematical rigor with practical implementability

### Implementation Feasibility
- Ensure the method description contains sufficient information for future code implementation
- Include clear algorithmic workflows or pseudocode where appropriate
- Define key data structures and computational procedures conceptually
- Consider computational complexity and practical constraints

**It should be emphasized that only **1-2** key, innovative, and clearly defined contributions are required, while removing any redundant, unimportant, or superfluous parts.**

Note: Only 1 or 2 clear contributions are required. Do not exceed this amount limit and do not stack contributions together.

Note that the original method information is no longer used, so you need to output the complete information of improved method so that researchers can understand it without the original method information.
